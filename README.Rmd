# remiod: Reference-based Controlled Multiple Imputation of Longitudinal Binary and Ordinal Outcomes with non-ignorable missingness 


The package **remiod** provides functionality to perform controlled multiple
imputation of binary and ordinal response in the Bayesian framework. Implemented are
(generalized) linear regression models for binary data and cumulative logistic models for
ordered categorical data. It is also possible to fit multiple models of mixed types
simultaneously. Missing values in (if present) will be imputed automatically.

**remiod** has two algorithmic backend. One is [JAGS](https://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.io/), with which the function performs some preprocessing of the data and creates a JAGS model, which will then automatically be
passed to [JAGS](https://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.io/) with the help of the R package [**rjags**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rjags). The another is based on the method proposed by Tang [@tang2017].

Besides the main modelling functions, **remiod** also provides functions to summarize and visualize results.

    
## Installation

you can install **remiod** from GitHub:
```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("xsswang/remiod")
```


## Main functions
**remiod** provides the following main functions:

``` r
remiod                      #processing data and implementing MCMC sampling
extract_MIdata              #extract imputed data sets
```

Currently, methods **remiod** implements include  missing at random \code{MAR}, jump-to-reference \code{J2R}, copy reference \code{CR}, and delta adjustment \code{delta}. For \code{method = "delta"}, argument \code{delta} should follow to specify a numerical values used in delta adjustment

Functions `summary()`, `coef()`, and `mcmclot()` provide a summary of the posterior distribution and its visualization.


## Minimal Example
### Visualize the observed data and missing data pattern
```{r, eval = FALSE}

data(schizow)

test = remiod(formula = y6 ~ tx + y0 + y1 + y3, data = schizow,
              trtvar = 'tx', algorithm = 'jags', method="MAR",
              ord_cov_dummy = FALSE, n.adapt = 10, n.chains = 1,
              n.iter = 100, thin = 2, warn = FALSE, seed = 1234)

extdt = extract_MIdata(object=test, method="J2R",mi.setting=NULL, M=10, minspace=2)

```
