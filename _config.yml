title: remiod: Reference-based Controlled Multiple Imputation of Longitudinal Binary and Ordinal Outcomes with non-ignorable missingness
email: ""
description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  **remiod** provides functionality to perform controlled multiple imputation of binary and ordinal response in the Bayesian framework. Implemented are (generalized) linear regression models for binary data and cumulative logistic models for ordered categorical data. It is also possible to fit multiple models of mixed types simultaneously. Missing values in (if present) will be imputed automatically.
